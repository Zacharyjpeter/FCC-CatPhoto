<h1>Cat Photo App</h1>
My very first project. A simple site for people who love cats. I learned the basics of HTML by building this.

My biggest challenge was understanding how forms work. The difference between id, name, and value confused me. I also made the rookie mistake of not pushing the project to Github until it was finished. That's why there's no commit history.
